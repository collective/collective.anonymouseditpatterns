This package was created to test several assumptions and suggestions to add some mockup patterns to the 
'anonymous' js/css delivery of pages in Plone 5.2 . Easyform is the defacto forms packages on Plone 5.2 when
you use Python3, but some of its fields require widgets that are by default only bundled and delivered to
logged in users.
